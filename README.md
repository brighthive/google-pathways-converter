# Google Pathways Converter

The `google-pathways-converter` is a Python package that converts a dictionary of keyword arguments into Google-pathways-friendly JSON-LD.  

## Motivation (Why did we build this?)

[Google Pathways](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/job-training) illuminates "pathways" for job seekers trying to acquire skills for a new role, job, or career. Google Pathways is an online utility integrated with the Google search engine: in other words, Google reads structured data from publicly available web pages, and if compatible with Pathways, the data appears in Google search results. *Try it for yourself!* Go to [Google](https://www.google.com/), and enter “job training and Richmond, VA”. You should see a panel with expandable results for jobs, paid training, and educational programs near Richmond. 

Google only ingests programs data that aligns with the schema definitions standardized by [schema.org](https://schema.org/). Schema.org specifies schemas for two program types: `WorkBasedProgram` and `EducationalOccupationalProgram`. A work-based program both provides job training and pays a wage. An educational-occupational program does not pay a wage, but offers a learning experience, which may or may not require the student to pay tuition and/or fees.

A BrightHive Data Trust may include data resources that describe work-based and/or educational-occupational programs. In many cases, Data Trust members want to easily, securely, and effectively disseminate information about their program offerings – something that Google Pathways facilitates. To this end, the `google-pathways-converter` library transforms data resources into Schema.org definitions, which can be consumed and returned by Google Pathways.

## Getting Started

### Installation
`google-pathways-converter` can be installed into your virtual environment in a number of ways. Pipenv users can run the following command:

```python
pipenv install -e git+https://github.com/brighthive/google-pathways-converter.git@master#egg=converter
```

Then, install the library wherever you need to it.

```python
from converter import educational_occupational_programs_converter, work_based_programs_converter
```

### Example

Below gives an example of the `educational_occupational_programs_converter`. Note: you can pass in a dict (recommended), or you may pass in the kwargs directly. If you use a dict, then remember to unpack it.

```python
from converter import educational_occupational_programs_converter

programs_input = {
    'application_deadline': '2020-04-01', 
    'program_name': 'Goodwill Program', 
    'offers_price': 2000, 
    'program_url': 'goodwill.org', 
    'provider_name': 'Goodwill of Springfield', 
    'provider_url': 'goodwill.org', 
    'provider_telephone': '333-343-4444', 
    'provider_address': [
        {
            'street_address': '1 Grickle Grass Lane', 
            'address_locality': 'Springfield', 
            'address_region': 'MA', 
            'postal_code': '88881'
        }
    ], 
    'time_to_complete': 'P6M', 
    'identifier_cip': '51.3333', 
    'identifier_program_id': '5688', 
    'application_start_date': '2020-01-01', 
    'program_prerequisites': {
        'credential_category': 'HighSchool', 
        'eligible_groups': 'Youth', 
        'max_income_eligibility': '20000', 
        'other_program_prerequisites': 'other'
    }, 
    'end_date': '2020-12-01', 
    'occupational_credential_awarded': 'Food Handlers Certification', 
    'maximum_enrollment': '50', 
    'start_date': '2020-04-01', 
    'time_of_day': 'Evening'

output = educational_occupational_programs_converter(**programs_input)
json.dumps(output, sort_keys=True)
```
